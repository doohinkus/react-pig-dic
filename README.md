This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# This project is still being developed. However, the mvp is playable. I'm working on the layout and images. I used Tachyons for the styling, but regret that choice. Nevertheless, I will continue to build out the project with "pure styles". Please check back.

Here is link to the project on surge: [React Pig Dice](http://nippy-memory.surge.sh/)

## React Pig Dice
Play pig dice against the computer. Roll a one and lose points and your turn. Hold to keep your points.
